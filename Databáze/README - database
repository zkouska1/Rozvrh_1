Easy_database
is a cumbersome module which serves for easy manipulation with sqlite_databases

methods:
    start - In order to create a database and a table, you need to use this to command, it takes two arguments
    ("name_of_first_column", "*variable_type")
    add_columns - IMO, this should be the second command to use, where you establish through a dict in format
    {"name_of_column":"variable_type"} other columns which you are gonna be using
    add_info - through this command you can start adding info to your columns
    show_everything - it returns a list with all the info in the database

*variable types are - text, integer, null, blob(objects), real(float)

Things to add:
    rename_columns
    modify_data - this one will be hard with the sqlite syntax
    make more user friendly start and add_columns


Limitations:
Every database can contain only one table, which might be better for understanding the program
but for longer run, it is a hideous thing

My suggestion:
I would leave


T = Easy_database("__Student_test")

T.start("id", "integer")

t = {"name":"text", "class":"integer"}
T.add_columns(t)

T.add_info("158", "Alex", "2")
T.add_info("159", "Pepa", "8")

print(T.show_everything())
