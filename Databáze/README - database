EASY_DATABASE module

    This is an almost complete module for database use + generating data.

    This database works on a SQL system, this means that when you create an object you automatically create a database,
    then you need to create tables with columns, where you can put your data in.

    I highly advise, for anyone who may want to use this module to carefully read the comments on objects, because
    you need to know the types of value types in sqlite.

    Every object who wants to use this module needs two functions in format:
    def name(self):
        return "name_of_class"

    def data(self):
        return self.something, self.something, self.something  ### Every data the class has in __init__ method

    Problems for future:  modify_data doesnt work, I have no idea why it doesnt work.
                          functions to show all tables, and overall better show functions
